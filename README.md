Recipe App with JSON Server and Backend Authentication
This recipe app is built with a frontend interface that interacts with a JSON Server acting as a mock API for recipe data. The application also includes backend authentication for user registration and login functionality.

Features
View a list of recipes
Search and filter recipes
Add new recipes
Update and delete existing recipes
User registration and login
Authentication-protected routes
Installation
Clone the repository:

shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/recipe-app.git
Install dependencies for the frontend:

shell
Copy code
cd recipe-app/frontend
npm install
Install dependencies for the JSON Server:

shell
Copy code
cd ../json-server
npm install
Usage
Start the JSON Server:

shell
Copy code
cd json-server
npm start
The JSON Server will start at http://localhost:8000 and provide the API endpoints for the recipe data.

In a separate terminal, start the frontend app:

shell
Copy code
cd frontend
npm start
The frontend app will run at http://localhost:3000, where you can access the recipe app in your browser.

Register a new user or use the provided test user credentials to log in.

Explore the recipe app and its features.

Backend Authentication
The backend authentication utilizes an authentication server and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user registration and login functionality. The server-side authentication logic is implemented using technologies like Node.js, Express, and a database (e.g., MongoDB) to store user information securely.

To set up the backend authentication:

Configure the backend authentication server by updating the necessary environment variables and database connection details.

Start the backend authentication server.

Ensure that the frontend app is configured to communicate with the backend authentication server by updating the appropriate API endpoints and configuration settings.

Test the user registration and login functionality to authenticate and authorize user access to the recipe app.
